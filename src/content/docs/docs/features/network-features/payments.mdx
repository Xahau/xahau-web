The Payments feature in the Xahau network is a crucial component that enables the transfer of assets and funds within the network. This feature is designed to facilitate seamless transactions, ensuring a smooth and efficient operation of the network.

### Transaction Types

The Payments feature comprises several transaction types, each serving a unique purpose in the network. Here's a brief overview of each transaction type:

**DepositPreauth**

This transaction type allows an account to preauthorize incoming transactions from a specified source. It's a way to whitelist accounts, ensuring that only authorized transactions are processed.
