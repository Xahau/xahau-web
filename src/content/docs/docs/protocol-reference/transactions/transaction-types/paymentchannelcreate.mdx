While the channel is open, the Amount can only go to the `Destination` address. When the channel closes, any unclaimed Amount is returned to the source address's balance.                                                                          |

Any transaction that would modify the channel after this time closes the channel without otherwise affecting it. This value is immutable; the channel can be closed earlier than this time but cannot remain open after this time. |
| `DestinationTag` | Number                                                                                                                             | UInt32              | _(Optional)_ Arbitrary tag to further specify the destination for this payment channel, such as a hosted recipient at the destination address.                                                                                                                                                                                |

If the `Destination` account is blocking incoming payment channels, the transaction fails with result code `tecNO_PERMISSION`. _(Requires the \[DisallowIncoming amendment]\[] :not_enabled:)_
