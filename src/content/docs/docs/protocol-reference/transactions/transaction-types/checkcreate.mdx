### Error Cases

* If the `Destination` account is blocking incoming Checks, the transaction fails with the result code `tecNO_PERMISSION`.&#x20;
* If the `Destination` is the sender of the transaction, the transaction fails with the result code `temREDUNDANT`.
* If the `Destination` account does not exist in the ledger, the transaction fails with the result code `tecNO_DST`.
* If the `Destination` account has the `RequireDest` flag enabled but the transaction does not include a `DestinationTag` field, the transaction fails with the result code `tecDST_TAG_NEEDED`.
* If `SendMax` specifies a token which is frozen, the transaction fails with the result `tecFROZEN`.
* If the `Expiration` of the transaction is in the past, the transaction fails with the result `tecEXPIRED`.
* If the sender does not have enough XAH to meet the owner reserve after adding the Check, the transaction fails with the result `tecINSUFFICIENT_RESERVE`.
* If either the sender or the destination of the Check cannot own more objects in the ledger, the transaction fails with the result `tecDIR_FULL`.
