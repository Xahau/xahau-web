| `CheckID`    | String                                                                                                                             | Hash256             | The ID of the Check ledger object to cash, as a 64-character hexadecimal string.                                                                                                                                                |
| `Amount`     | [Currency Amount](https://docs.xahau.network/technical/protocol-reference/data-types/currency-formats#specifying-currency-amounts) | Amount              | _(Optional)_ Redeem the Check for exactly this amount, if possible. The currency must match that of the `SendMax` of the corresponding CheckCreate transaction. You must provide either this field or `DeliverMin`.             |
| `DeliverMin` | \[Currency Amount]\[]                                                                                                              | Amount              | _(Optional)_ Redeem the Check for at least this amount and for as much as possible. The currency must match that of the `SendMax` of the corresponding CheckCreate transaction. You must provide either this field or `Amount`. |

The transaction _**must**_ include either `Amount` or `DeliverMin`, but not both.

### Error Cases

* If the sender of the CheckCash transaction is not the `Destination` of the check, the transaction fails with the result code `tecNO_PERMISSION`.
* If the Check identified by the `CheckID` field does not exist, the transaction fails with the result `tecNO_ENTRY`.
* If the Check identified by the `CheckID` field has already expired, the transaction fails with the result `tecEXPIRED`.
* If the destination of the Check has the `RequireDest` flag enabled but the Check, as created, does not have a destination tag, the transaction fails with the result code `tecDST_TAG_NEEDED`.
* If the transaction specifies both `Amount` and `DeliverMin`, or omits both, the transaction fails with the result `temMALFORMED`.
* If the `Amount` or `DeliverMin` does not match the currency (and issuer, if not XAH) of the Check, the transaction fails with the result `temBAD_CURRENCY`.
