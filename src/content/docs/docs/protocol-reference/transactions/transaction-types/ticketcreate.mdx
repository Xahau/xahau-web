### Example

```json
{
    "TransactionType": "TicketCreate",
    "Account": "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn",
    "Fee": "10",
    "Sequence": 381,
    "TicketCount": 10
}
```

| Field         | JSON Type | \[Internal Type]\[] | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TicketCount` | Number    | UInt32              | How many Tickets to create. This must be a positive number and cannot cause the account to own more than 250 Tickets after executing this transaction. |

If the transaction cannot create _all_ of the requested Tickets (either due to the 250-Ticket limit or the owner reserve), it fails and creates no Tickets. To look up how many Tickets an account currently owns, use the \[account_info method]\[] and check the `account_data.TicketCount` field.

**Tip:** This transaction increases the sending account's \[sequence number]\[Sequence Number] by 1 _plus_ the number of tickets created (`TicketCount`). This is the only transaction that increases an account's sequence number by more than 1.

### Error Cases

Besides errors that can occur for all transactions, TicketCreate transactions can result in the following transaction result codes:

| Error Code                | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `temINVALID_COUNT`        | The `TicketCount` field is invalid. It must be an integer from 1 to 250.                                                                                    |
| `tecDIR_FULL`             | This transaction would cause the account to own more than the limit of 250 Tickets at a time, or more than the maximum number of ledger objects in general. |
| `tecINSUFFICIENT_RESERVE` | The sending account does not have enough XAH to meet the owner reserve of all the requested Tickets.                                                        |
