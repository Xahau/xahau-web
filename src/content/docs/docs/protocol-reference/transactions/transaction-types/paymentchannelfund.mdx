This must be later than either the current time plus the `SettleDelay` of the channel, or the existing `Expiration` of the channel. After the `Expiration` time, any transaction that would access the channel closes the channel without taking its normal action. Any unspent Amount is returned to the source address when the channel closes. (`Expiration` is separate from the channel's immutable `CancelAfter` time.)
