The `Offer` ledger entry describes an Offer to exchange currencies in Xahau's decentralized exchange. (In finance, this is more traditionally known as an _order_.) An \[OfferCreate transaction]\[] only creates an `Offer` entry in the ledger when the Offer cannot be fully executed immediately by consuming other Offers already in the ledger.

An Offer can become unfunded through other activities in the network while remaining in the ledger. When processing transactions, the network automatically prunes any unfunded Offers that those transactions come across. (Otherwise, unfunded Offers remain because _only_ transactions can change the ledger state.)

### Offer Flags

There are several options that can be either enabled or disabled when an \[OfferCreate transaction]\[] creates an offer object. In the ledger, flags are represented as binary values that can be combined with bitwise-or operations. The bit values for the flags in the ledger are different than the values used to enable or disable those flags in a transaction. Ledger flags have names that begin with **`lsf`**.

`Offer` objects can have the following flag values:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="135"></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Flag Name</td><td>Hex Value</td><td>Decimal Value</td><td>Corresponding OfferCreate Flag</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td><code>lsfPassive</code></td><td><code>0x00010000</code></td><td>65536</td><td><code>tfPassive</code></td><td>The object was placed as a passive Offer. This has no effect on the object in the ledger.</td></tr><tr><td><code>lsfSell</code></td><td><code>0x00020000</code></td><td>131072</td><td><code>tfSell</code></td><td>The object was placed as a sell Offer. This has no effect on the object in the ledger (because <code>tfSell</code> only matters if you get a better rate than you asked for, which cannot happen after the object enters the ledger).</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Offer ID Format

The ID of an `Offer` object is the \[SHA-512Half]\[] of the following values, concatenated in order:

* The Offer space key (`0x006F`)
* The AccountID of the account placing the Offer
*   The Sequence number of the \[OfferCreate transaction]\[] that created the Offer.

    If the OfferCreate transaction used a Ticket, use the `TicketSequence` value instead.
