_(Added by the \[TicketBatch amendment]\[].)_

The `Ticket` object type represents a Ticket, which tracks an account \[sequence number]\[Sequence Number] that has been set aside for future use. You can create new tickets with a \[TicketCreate transaction]\[]. \[New in: rippled 1.7.0]\[]

### Fields

A `Ticket` object has the following fields:

| Name                | JSON Type | Internal Type | Required? | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Account`           | String    | AccountID     | Yes       | The account that owns this Ticket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Flags`             | Number    | UInt32        | Yes       | A bit-map of boolean flags enabled for this object. Currently, the protocol defines no flags for `Ticket` objects. The value is always `0`.                                                                                                                               |
| `LedgerEntryType`   | String    | UInt16        | Yes       | The value `0x0054`, mapped to the string `Ticket`, indicates that this object is a Ticket object.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `OwnerNode`         | String    | UInt64        | Yes       | A hint indicating which page of the owner directory links to this object, in case the directory consists of multiple pages. **Note:** The object does not contain a direct link to the owner directory containing it, since that value can be derived from the `Account`. |
| `PreviousTxnID`     | String    | Hash256       | Yes       | The identifying hash of the transaction that most recently modified this object.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `TicketSequence`    | Number    | UInt32        | Yes       | The \[Sequence Number]\[] this Ticket sets aside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Ticket ID Format

* The Ticket space key (`0x0054`)
* The AccountID of the owner of the Ticket
* The `TicketSequence` number of the Ticket
