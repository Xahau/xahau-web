The Xahau documentation is open source and open for contributions [on GitHub](https://github.com/Xahau/xahau-web).

A lot of gaps and uncovered details are expected in the documentation, so we invite **everyone** to collaborate on bringing it up to standard.

Do you see anything that is missing, please [create an issue](https://github.com/Xahau/xahau-web/issues) on the repository or just go ahead and create a pull request to the main branch, with suggested changes or updated documentation.

If you would like to contribute, but don't know what to do, you can always refer to the [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/orgs/Xahau/projects/2/views/1) where issues are organized. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, the [Community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UzU58haAn4) is a great place to get help and get involved.
