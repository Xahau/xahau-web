### How can I debug a Hook?

The Hook API provides a set of functions in the namespace `trace` which write output to the `xrpld` log file when xrpld is configured with the _trace_ log-level. These functions, generally speaking, allow you to see the value of variables, buffers and otherwise trace the execution and state of a Hook at runtime.

<Aside type="tip">
At time of writing there is no interactive Hook Debugger. You must use the trace functions.

### Trace APIs

The following `trace` functions are available in the Hooks API

| Hook API                                                                | What it does                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [trace](../technical/hooks-functions/trace-debug/trace.md)              | Print a utf-8 message, followed by a user-specified buffer (this last optionally as hex.) |
| [trace_num](../technical/hooks-functions/trace-debug/trace_num.md)     | Print a utf-8 message, followed by an integer.                                            |
| [trace_float](../technical/hooks-functions/trace-debug/trace_float.md) | Print a utf-8 message, followed by an XFL Floating point number.                          |

### Example

The following code will print a single trace line then accept the Originating Transaction.

```c
#include "../hookapi.h"
int64_t hook(int64_t reserved)
{
  trace_num(SBUF("A number"), 10);
  accept(0,0,0);
  return 0;
}
```

An example of the log-line produced by `xahaud` when a payment is sent out of or into the Hook Account:

```
2021-Apr-13 13:59:11.083700726 UTC View:TRC
    HookTrace[rHb9CJAWyB4rj91VRWn96DkukG4bwdtyTh-rE3SfnjwfzZFL3JK9cLVfJuy8Ar1XnCqPw]:
        A number 10
```

The above appears in the log as all-one-line, but split here for visibility.

### Log format

A breakdown of the log format appears in the table below

<Aside type="tip">
`Xahaud` produces a lot of output. It is therefore generally advisible to grep logs for the account/s you are interested in.

For example use: `tail -f log | grep HookTrace | grep <account>`
