### Constraints

All Hooks are compiled to a single [webassembly module](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/syntax/modules.html) before they can be set onto an Xahau account.

A Hook always implements and exports exactly one or both of the following functions:

`int64_t hook(uint32_t ctx) { ... }` _required_

* Executed whenever a transaction comes into or leaves from the account the Hook is set on (`ctx = 0`) or
* Executed when executed as a [Weak Transactional Stakeholder](weak-and-strong.md) (`ctx > 0`).

`int64_t cbak(uint32_t ctx) { ... }` _optional_

* Executed when an emitted transaction is successfully accepted into a ledger (`ctx = 0`) or
* Executed when an emitted transaction cannot be accepted into any ledger (`ctx = 1`).

Hooks are not allowed to specify other functions. Instead they must make clever use of macros to do all their computation within these two functions. This is part of a computational restriction on hooks to keep their runtime predictable.

Additionally Hooks are afforded no _heap_ memory. All required memory must be reserved and used on the stack.

### Example

Here is an example Hook written in C. The Hook prints 0...3 to the trace log before accepting the originating transaction.

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#define GUARD(maxiter) _g(__LINE__, (maxiter)+1)
extern int32_t _g (uint32_t id, uint32_t maxiter);
extern int64_t accept (uint32_t read_ptr, uint32_t read_len, int64_t error_code);
extern int64_t trace_num (uint32_t read_ptr, uint32_t read_len, int64_t number);

int64_t hook(uint32_t ctx)
{
    for (int i = 0; GUARD(3), i < 3; ++i)
    {
        trace_num("test", 4, i);
    }
    accept (0,0,0); 
    return 0;
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
For educational purposes the above example deliberately does not include `hookapi.h` (which developers would typically use.)

### Compilation

A [variety of compilers](https://www.google.com/search?q=webassembly+compiler+C) will generate valid webassembly from a C source file. Once compiled, a Hook exists as a binary `.wasm` file. This contains a webassembly module. Using `wasmcc` to compile and the `wasm2wat` tool to convert to human readable webassembly this binary form can be rendered to the human readable form. Below appears the compilation result of the above example.

```

The average Hook developer will never need to examine webassembly directly. However it is a useful conceptual exercise to review the contents of the sample Hook.

Above we can see:

* Three functions are imported from the Hooks API (`_g`, `accept`, `trace_num`)
* Two functions are defined by the hook (`cbak`, `hook`)
* Two functions are exported by the hook (again: `cbak`, `hook`)
* Some static (constant) data is recorded in the hook (see `data` at the bottom).

It is very important to note that a Hook _must only_ import functions available to it from the Hooks API and _must_ only export the `cbak` and `hook` functions. In additional all hooks must import `_g` from the Hooks API, which is the `guard` function.

Webassembly is a platform-independent general computation `bytecode` language. It has a one-to-one mapping with a human readable equivalent. These are used interchangeably.

### Unwanted Exports

Most webassembly compilers (including the one above) produce additional exports for their own linking purposes. In many cases the generation of these is difficult or impossible to disable.

Unwanted exports will lead to an otherwise valid Hook being rejected. Therefore after compilation developers should use the [Hook Cleaner Utility](https://github.com/XRPLF/hook-cleaner-c) to strip out these out. Failure to do so will lead to your Hook being rejected.

Don't forget to use the [Hook Cleaner Utility](https://github.com/XRPLF/hook-cleaner-c) or your Hooks will be rejected.
