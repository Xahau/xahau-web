Each category is designed to provide you with detailed insights and instructions about different aspects of Xahau.

### Features

The Features section is where you'll find information about the unique aspects of Xahau. One of the key areas covered in this section is Developer Tooling.

Our Developer Tooling page covers Hooks Tools and Client Libraries, simplifying the process of interacting with Hooks and the Xahau Ledger. This section is designed to help you understand the functionality and capabilities of Xahau, with practical examples to help illustrate these features in action.

### Protocol Reference

The Protocol Reference section of Xahau's documentation provides an in-depth look at the platform's unique aspects, including various transaction types like AccountDelete, CheckCancel, and Payment, each with its own specific use and characteristics.&#x20;

It also covers the different ledger objects integral to the network's operation, such as AccountRoot and Amendments. This comprehensive overview aims to enhance the understanding of Xahau's functionalities and capabilities, ensuring users can fully leverage the network's features.

### Infrastructure

The Infrastructure section provides detailed instructions for setting up the build environment on both Ubuntu 22.04 and macOS 13.5.2.

In the 'Building Xahau' chapter, you will find a step-by-step guide through the process of establishing environmental variables, installing core and Xahaud dependencies, and compiling the software.

This includes the acquisition and setup of essential components like LLVM, Boost, WasmEdge, and Protobuf. The steps explain why certain versions and configurations are needed to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.

This section ends with cloning the Xahau repository and creating the Xahaud target, setting developers on the path to adding to or deploying the Xahau network.
