Welcome to the Xahau Documentation. This is your comprehensive guide to understanding and working with Xahau. This documentation is divided into three main categories: Features, Infrastructure, and Technical.

Each category is designed to provide you with detailed insights and instructions about different aspects of Xahau.

### Features

The Features section is where you'll find information about the unique aspects of Xahau. One of the key areas covered in this section is Developer Tooling.

Our Developer Tooling page covers Hooks Tools and Client Libraries, simplifying the process of interacting with Hooks and the Xahau Ledger. This section is designed to help you understand the functionality and capabilities of Xahau, with practical examples to help illustrate these features in action.

### Protocol Reference

The Protocol Reference section of Xahau's documentation provides an in-depth look at the platform's unique aspects, including various transaction types like AccountDelete, CheckCancel, and Payment, each with its own specific use and characteristics.&#x20;

It also covers the different ledger objects integral to the network's operation, such as AccountRoot and Amendments. This comprehensive overview aims to enhance the understanding of Xahau's functionalities and capabilities, ensuring users can fully leverage the network's features.

### Infrastructure

Infrastructure is the core of the Xahau Network. Servers running the xahaud software enable users to do things like submit, verify, and query transactions. The documentation in this section provides instructions for installing, updating, configuring, and building xahaud. Concepts, such as attesting to the identity of a given server or running xahaud as a validator, are also discussed.
