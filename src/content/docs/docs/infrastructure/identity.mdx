title: Serving a TOML File for Identity Verification
---
Given that trust is foundational to the Xahau Network, it is ideal that xahaud validator operators take credit for their validators. This is is done by publishing two attestations: one from a validating server on the Xahau Network and a second from a webserver that serves the identifying domain over TLS. Similarly, individual Xahau account holders might wish to publish a TOML file attesting that specific accounts on the network are under their control. This is particularly relevant for enterprises, such as exchanges or financial institutions.
