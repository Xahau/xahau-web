title: System Requirements
---
Hardware requirements for nodes (RPC, hubs, validators, etc.) should be generally along the lines of the specs outlined below.

For specific node use cases (e.g. full history) specs may differ (and grow) over time.

### Nodes should run (reasonably) well for own use with:

* CPU: Minimum 8 cores
* Memory: Minimum 16GB (32GB+ advised)
* Disk IO: Minimum 10k random RW
* Disk size: Contingent on the amount of history stored. Memory databases take virtually no disk space, while full history requires 10TB+.
* Filesystem: Machines storing full history should use XFS or similar, to avoid limitations with single file size in EXT4. If storing less history, EXT4 is sufficient.
* Network IO: 100Mbit+

***As of August 6, 2025 the full history for the Xahau Network is approximately 8TB***

### Production Server Recommended Specs:
