title: Updating xahaud
---
The process for updating xahaud varies depending on the install method used, however, all three methods rely on the releases published at [https://build.xahau.tech](https://build.xahau.tech). When updating a validator, hub, or other 'critical' infrastructure, please check the network health prior to restarting a server to install an update.

### Backup
Users should always keep backups of:
1. The primary configuration file: `xahaud.cfg`
    - Location varies based on install type.
2. The trusted validators file: `validators-xahau.txt`
    - Location is specified in 'xahaud.cfg'.
3. The server's identity credentials: `wallet.db`
    - Located in the database directory defined in 'xahaud.cfg'.
4. Validators must keep their validation private key backed up in a secure, offline location.

### Updating Docker Containers

### Updating Local Installations
Will go here

### Updating Binary Files
Updating the xahaud binary files is essentially the same as the original install instructions:
1. Remove the currently running version: `rm [/path/to/xahaud]`
2. Download the new version: [https://build.xahau.tech/](https://build.xahau.tech)
3. Mark the download as executable: `chmod 500 [/path/to/xahaud]`
4. Start xahaud: `./[path/to/xahud] --net --conf [/path/to/xahaud.cfg]`
