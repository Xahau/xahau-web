# H1 2025

## 1. Project "L10K"

Improve core technology efficiency to boost transaction capacity to 10,000 transactions per ledger for better efficiency and security.

A milestone in performance for the Xahau ecosystem!

## 2. Improve UDP Monitoring & RPC

Connection-less monitoring and RPC features for node operators optimize performance and scalability across the network. 

Allowing for efficient, passive monitoring of single or multi-node environments - significantly reducing the overhead.

## 3. Finalized New Features (Remarks, Touch, Blackhole, DataMonitor)

Complete development and integration of these cutting-edge features, improving interaction with Xahau for developers as well as end-users through products built by developers.

## 4. Ledger Hardware Wallet Full Support for Xahau

Ensure secure, streamlined Xahau transactions with Ledger Hardware Wallet compatibility, opening up accessibility to Xahau worldwide.

## 5. Exchange and On/Off-Ramp Access

Xahau is intended to become more accessible through exchanges and on/off-ramp platforms, supporting broader participation and integration within the ecosystem.

## 6. LedgerLive Support

Xahau integration with Ledger Live, enabling easy access and management using the popular Ledger Live product.

## 7. Universal Embeddable Hook Explainer Frame

Allowing any wallet to easily integrate a clear explanation of the influence of Hooks on transactions (web, mobile, desktop) with clear, integrated visuals for HookSet transactions, ensuring easier adoption.

# H2 2025

## 8. JavaScript Hooks Implementation

Pending audit approval, bring JavaScript-based Hooks and tooling to tens of millions of developers around the world to develop using Xahau for advanced on-chain logic and programmable transaction capabilities.

## 9. Comprehensive Audits & Security Checks

Complete audits for all major 2025 features to demonstrate the security and stability of the network, providing verifiable assurance to the world as we head into 2026.

## 10. Improved User Experience

Guided by feedback, the Xahau ecosystem is set to ensure seamless integration and usability across all wallets and applications.

## 11. Batch Implementation

Enable efficient multi-transaction verifications, ensuring either all or no transactions occur while allowing service providers to incorporate workflow-specific operations seamlessly into the transaction flow.

**2025 is the year Xahau becomes easier to access, use, leverage, and build on while scaling smarter, faster, and stronger.**
