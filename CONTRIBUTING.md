# Thank You!
Public contributions to the documentation are welcome. When contributing, please help with consistency and clarity by adhering to the below guidelines.

# Disambiguation
* Strive for brevity and clarity. Avoid jargon and use a professional writing tone. Adhere to standards, such as [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
* When referring to the software `xahaud`, use a lowercase "x" and include the 'd'. When referring to the broader `Xahau Network`, capitalize both terms and,if appropriate, subsequently use the capitalized term "the Network". Use the capitalized `Xahau` or the all caps abbreviation `XAH` when referring to the currency.
* Be mindful that this documentation is shared by a global community. Avoid culture-specific jargon or slang.

# Formatting
* Relative and absolute linking are both permitted. When changing the directory structure or renaming individual pages, use grep to ensure all links are updated. Header, footer, index page, navigation bar, and links on other pages all need to be updated manually.
* The use of second person ("you") is permitted.
* Individual webpages may be formatted using Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in any combination. To the extent possible, favor style templates and avoid inline CSS.
* When using bulleted or numbered lists end sentences with a period ('.'), unless doing so interferes with content. For example, if a bulleted list item ends with a link to a webpage, do not add a '.' at the end of the link, as doing so breaks the link. Similarly, do not add a '.' after code snippets.
* Capitalize proper nouns, including "Testnet" and "Mainnet". Prefer single word for these terms.
* Use square brackets inside code snippets to offset user specific information, such as file names and paths. For example: `cd [/path/to/xahaud] && ./xahaud server_info`
* Wrap multi-line code examples in three backticks: ` ``` `.

# General Guidelines
* Include meaningful commit messages.
